THE BIEN TRAITS DATASET
```{r}
#exploring the BIEN database
#use vignette("BIEN_tutorial") for instructions on how to extract data from the database

#this gives a list of all the traits that this database has information on - 55 different traits.
BIEN_trait_list <- BIEN_trait_list()

#make a vector of my 753 species
list_sp <- species_list$binomial_name 
  
#now do some cleanup of the species list  
list_sp_cleaned <- list_sp %>%
  iconv(from = "", to = "UTF-8", sub = "byte") %>% #force encoding to UTF-8 and replace non-convertible characters
  gsub(pattern = "\u00a0", replacement = " ", .) %>% #replace non-breaking space (\u00a0)
  trimws() #trim whitespace

```


```{r}
#BIEN_trait_mean estimates species mean trait values for a given trait, using Genus or Family level data where species level data is absent
average_seed_mass = BIEN_trait_mean(species = list_sp_cleaned, trait = "seed mass")

write.csv(average_seed_mass, file = "average seed mass.csv", row.names = FALSE)
#this assigns seed mass to all 753 species. It produces a dataframe which tells you the mean seed mass, the level used (family, genus or species) and the sample size used to produce that mean.

#BIEN_trait_traitby species extracts entries that conatin the specified species and traits. So this extracts the records only for the species that match exactly. If a species does not match, then it does not produce an estimate based on Genus or Family level
seed_mass_by_species <- BIEN_trait_traitbyspecies(species = list_sp_cleaned, trait = "seed mass")
  
write.csv(seed_mass_by_species, file = "seed mass by species.csv", row.names = FALSE)
#there are 69 records at species level from my list of 753. But these 69 records are not necessarily 69 different species. some species appear to have more than one record. This dataset shows that the seed mas is the average seed mass of 1000 seed, and that most of the data come from SID (Seed Information Database) from kew gardens. 
```
```{r}
#looking at seed size size
average_seed_length = BIEN_trait_mean(species = list_sp_cleaned, trait = "seed length")


seed_length_by_species <- BIEN_trait_traitbyspecies(species = list_sp_cleaned, trait = "seed length")
#shows that data comes from datadryad database
```


```{r}
#looking at flower colour
# I can't use in BIEN_trait_mean because flower colour is not a numerical variable - it is categorical.
flower_colour_BIEN <- BIEN_trait_traitbyspecies(species = list_sp_cleaned, trait = "flower color")
#out of my 753 species, only 3 have flower colour data in BIEN

# see how many species have flower colour data in BIEN
flower_colour_all <- BIEN_trait_trait("flower color")
length(unique(flower_colour_all$scrubbed_species_binomial))  
#2624 species contain information on flower colour. But clearly, only 3 of these are in my Danum dataset.

```

```{r}
#i want to check how many species from my 750 have any information in BIEN at all

all_species_all_traits <- BIEN_trait_species(species = list_sp_cleaned)

```





OTHER PLANT TRAIT DATASETS
```{r}
#Tallo
tallo <- read.csv(here("Tallo.csv"))

#wood densities
wood_densities <- read.csv(here("GlobalWoodDensityDatabase.csv"))
```



```{r}
#filtering out the flower_traits dataset, to only look at the 754 species that appear in the final_species_list 

#in the flower_traits dataset, change the column name from species to binomial_name
flower_traits <- flower_traits %>%
  rename(binomial_name = species)


# Filter flower_traits to only include species in final_species_list
filtered_flower_traits <- flower_traits %>%
  semi_join(final_species_list, by = "binomial_name")

#this filtered_flower_traits dataframe includes 50 species, meaning that there are 50 species in the flower_traits dataset that also appear in the unlogged_species dataset. This, of course, does not take into account that there might be alternative names for the same plant.
```
