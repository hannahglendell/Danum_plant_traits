**DOCUMENT SETUP**

```{r}
library(here)#for telling R where my working directory is
library(BIEN)#contains the BIEN dataset
library(dplyr)#for manipulating dataframes
```

note: I couldn't install BIEN because my R would not install the package RPostgreSQL. This code seemed to fix the problem: install.packages("RPostgreSQL", type = "binary")

**CREATING THE DANUM SPECIES LIST**

```{r}
#read in the list of unlogged tree species
unlogged_species <- read.csv(here("Danum_spp_list_unlogged.csv"))

#create a new column with the full binomial latin name of each species
unlogged_species$binomial_name <- paste(unlogged_species$Genus, unlogged_species$Species)

#create a dataframe of just the species names of unlogged trees.
unlogged_species_list <- unlogged_species %>% 
  select(binomial_name) %>%
  mutate(logging_status = "unlogged") %>%
  distinct() #removes any duplicates from the list

```

```{r}
#read in the dataset of logged tree species
logged_species <- read.csv(here("DanumRevised_35Plots_FullPlotData_Trees_2020_edit_4.11.csv"))

#create a column with the full binomial latin name of each species
logged_species$binomial_name <- paste(logged_species$Genus, logged_species$Species)

#make a list of distinct species names from the logged trees.
logged_species_list <- logged_species %>%
  select(binomial_name) %>% #selects just the binomial_name column 
  distinct() %>% #removes duplicates from the list of species
  mutate(logging_status = "logged")

```

```{r}
#now combine the logged_species_list and the unlogged_species_list together
#bind_rows() combines the two dataframes together
#group_by() groups according to binomial name
#summarize() - if a species appears more than once in the list, it is assigned "both" as its logging status, otherwise, it is assigned the logging_status that it already had when the dataframes were separate
#ungroup() ungroups the data

final_species_list <- bind_rows(logged_species_list, unlogged_species_list)%>% 
  group_by(binomial_name) %>% 
  summarize(logging_status = if (n() > 1) "both" else first(logging_status)) %>%
  ungroup() 
#this results in a list of 754 species in total


#seeing how many species there are in each logging status
final_species_list %>%
  count(logging_status)
#this tells me that there are 95 logged species, 394 unlogged species, and 265 species that appear in both logged and unlogged areas.

```

**ADDING IN THE PLANT TRAIT DATASETS**

```{r}
#read in the plant trait datasets
#flower trait data
flower_traits <- read.csv(here("Flower_Trait_Data.csv"))

#Tallo
tallo <- read.csv(here("Tallo.csv"))

#wood densities
wood_densities <- read.csv(here("GlobalWoodDensityDatabase.csv"))
```

```{r}
#filtering out the flower_traits dataset, to only look at the ~750 species that appear in the final_species_list 

#in the flower_traits dataset, change the column name from species to binomial_name
flower_traits <- flower_traits %>%
  rename(binomial_name = species)


# Filter flower_traits to only include species in unlogged_species
filtered_flower_traits <- flower_traits %>%
  semi_join(final_species_list, by = "binomial_name")

#this filtered_flower_traits dataframe includes 50 species, meaning that there are 50 species in the flower_traits dataset that also appear in the unlogged_species dataset. This, of course, does not take into account that there might be alternative names for the same plant.
```

```{r}
#exploring the BIEN database
#use vignette("BIEN_tutorial") for instructions on how to extract data from the database
#this gives a list of all the traits that this database has information on - 55 different traits.
BIEN_trait_list <- BIEN_trait_list()
#I will need to work out how to extract the traits for all the species I am interested in

#to look at all observations of flower color:
BIEN_flower_colour <- BIEN_trait_trait(trait = "flower color")
#this shows that there are around 3400 species for which there is data on flower colour

#
```
