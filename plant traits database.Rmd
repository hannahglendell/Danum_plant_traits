```{r}
library(here)
library(BIEN)
```
note: I coudln't install BIEN because my R would not install the package RPostgreSQL. This code seemed to fix the problem: install.packages("RPostgreSQL", type = "binary")

```{r}
#read in the list of unlogged tree species
unlogged_species <- read.csv(here("Danum_spp_list_unlogged.csv"))
```

```{r}
#read in the plant trait datasets
#flower trait data
flower_traits <- read.csv(here("Flower_Trait_Data.csv"))

#Tallo
tallo <- read.csv(here("Tallo.csv"))

#wood densities
wood_densities <- read.csv(here("GlobalWoodDensityDatabase.csv"))
```

```{r}
#exploring the BIEN database
#this gives a list of all the traits that this database has information on.
#I will need to work out how to extract the traits for all the species I am interested in
BIEN_trait_list <- BIEN_trait_list()

#to look at all observations of flower color:
flower_colour <- BIEN_trait_trait(trait = "flower color")
#this shows that there are around 3400 species for which there is data on flower colour
```
